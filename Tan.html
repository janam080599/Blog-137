      Who is she? I asked myself, pacing around in a room full of thoughts,
      insecure about my future, stressed! Is it the time that the person who I
      am on the inside meets the one that is visible to everyone else? The
      tension subsided when I got to eat one of my favorite meals for the first
      time in America made by my Mom but nothing lasts forever and I do know
      that it goes both ways but real happiness had eluded me for quite some
      time now, and despite being surrounded by my family and friends, I felt
      alone. I have always felt that way ever since I started to understand the
      nuance of things, of life, but this time it was different, more intense,
      and I felt lost, defeated. I have never in my life felt defeated. I am so
      confident in my abilities, in me and don't get me wrong, I still am.
      Anyways, amidst all this chaos, one thought strikingly struck out and
      popped out and highlighted itself as it had done many times in the past,
      especially in the last few days. It was about her, the contact in my phone
      that was spelled as Tan with a purple heart emoji.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, she loves to use the purple heart emoji and you can’t help but feel
      good when she uses that talking to you. I, as a person, am very analytical
      and very observational and I believe I can differentiate between good
      people and bad people. I have been wrong in the past, but I have been
      right a greater number of times than I have not, and before I came to call
      her my friend, she was a friend of a friend and I got to meet her from
      time to time. It was always a good day when she came home. I liked her
      presence! I found her to be incredibly kind and a person with a good
      heart, so different from my initial judgement of her, but this I was sure
      of! She did disappoint me a couple of times in the last few months, and I
      got so angry, I called her selfish in my mind, and scolded myself because
      of that, but I never doubted my judgement of her. She was putting herself
      first and I took offence at that, and soon I realized I was wrong, and
      people do that, even the good ones and that I should do that more often
      too, ahh, that will take a lot of time. Need to change years of putting
      others first! I do digress a lot, coming back to the point, it’s an irony,
      I was not even her friend and I got to meet her more times than I have
      after being one. Actually, we don’t meet at all anymore. I do understand
      though, she had less friends then in a new country and now she has an army
      in her very apartment community, and I am happy for that fact (even though
      I am the best) and she has gotten used to doing assignments and giving OAs
      on her own as well which is fantastic! I am so elated that she's doing
      that. I will be available for her whenever she needs me though, that she
      can count on. I can't force anyone to meet me or talk to me. I just 
      want to put it out there that I like talking to her, I miss her from time 
      to time and I know she doesn't feel that way and that is fine, even though 
      its not love just friendship we are talking about here. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I was so happy when she called me to inform that she had cracked an
      internship. I talked to her normally, and I did not show the amount of
      happiness I had or the pride I had. She would have felt so weird knowing
      that I was probably more excited and over the moon than she was or anybody
      else for that matter because I have seen her struggle. I have seen her
      work hard! Everyone does struggle, but having seen her upfront closely and
      knowing the type of person she is (she gets tensed a lot), I knew what it
      meant to her and I am the kind of person, once I decide to support someone
      in any way I can, I will be with them forever and I will have their back
      and will stand by them in whatever capacity they allow me to and beyond
      even if they find my behavior odd or too intrusive, I don’t care then
      because I know I am doing a good thing. You guys can debate over whether
      that’s the right way of thinking or the wrong way and both sides will be
      correct, I know that, but I can’t help it, it is who I am. I have been on
      my toes ever since I misbehaved with her once, I couldn't control my
      emotions which I normally do so well. I was rude and shouted and cursed at
      her, she had cancelled a plan that was getting cancelled again and again
      but once again understanding that meeting her was probably way more
      important to me than it was for her. Maybe she had other things on her
      plate, and I don’t have any right to expect anything from her. At least,
      now I know so to not expect anything from anyone. Good life lesson for
      everyone. Until you put a solid label on any kind of relationship, you are
      bound to go down if you expect. Expectations have always let people down
      and I was one more victim down the drain and that has happened before. I
      guess some people never learn and I am one of them. Was she wrong that
      day? Maybe, maybe not, I don't want to get into that! We never know what
      the other person is going through and knowing her, she must have had good
      reasons to repeatedly cancel our plans. But was I wrong in the way I
      handled the matter? Absolutely! I felt so ashamed of myself for days,
      crying myself to sleep the first two nights and then a couple. This is not
      how my mama raised me (Forrest Gump fans, say aye!) Well, there is always
      room for self-improvement and I have a long, long way to go.
    </p>

      One of my best memories with her was a dinner we had followed by a movie.
      Gosh! She looked gorgeous that day and I couldn’t take my eyes off her.
      How can someone be so pristine, said my hard beating heart to the over
      thinking brain of mine. I remember her telling me that she was having a
      bad hair day and all I wanted to tell her then was to shut up because at
      that moment she was the most beautiful girl I had seen, her sitting at the
      restaurant with the wonderful background was the purest image in my mind.
      I remember everything so vividly; I could have someone draw it and have it
      framed. One of the few photos I have with her, the first one was clicked
      that day. I had such a good conversation and she opened up as well telling
      me in detail about her family, her boyfriend and many things. Hers and
      Ranjan's (her bf) story is a dream and all you can say after hearing that
      is Aww! Can’t wait to dance at her wedding. I will be cheering her on from
      now on. She can be assured of having someone along in her journey
      celebrating any major or minor achievements or helping her deal with any
      difficulties if she allows me to. I hope she does! Coming back to this
      enchanting evening I had, while going to the movie, she remarked and her
      exact words were, ‘Theatre to khali hai, agar mein single hoti, tere to
      maze hote’. Two reactions to that statement, the first being ‘Chalo is
      layak to samja, I guess am not that bad looking. Can work on my weight fir
      to stud to apun hai hi’. Not that I needed the validation, still feels
      nice na, when you hear such things. And the second reaction was ‘Yaar
      pehli baar kisi ke saath bahar aaya hu, and aisa bola, aisa soch ke rakha
      hai kya mere baare mein. Shit! I am not this person, maybe I need to talk
      less about my encounters with women!’. Well, not making much of what she
      said or what my thoughts were, just felt that I should share this with you
      guys.

      We danced that day. I had asked for her favorite song (John Legend’s All
      of Me. The only English song I know the lyrics to!). I was so terrified of
      asking her to dance because of multiple reasons. I can’t forget the fate
      of my idiot roommate. He is a dick though and I did not have other
      thoughts in my mind (I am not in love with her 😉), so I ignored that, and
      she had danced with me once in my home before so I thought it would be
      okay! And I had asked Tan for a walk on the lake, and she changed the
      topic (or was it after the dinner date, umm, it’s still important to know
      this reason because I think it may be the reason for many of her decisions
      including the last couple of months). I later got to know from my roommate
      that she tries to avoid these things with other people because of how
      Ranjan may feel or maybe because she wants to do all that with him and not
      with anyone else (my conclusions). Sweet, yes, silly, YES! Regardless of
      what I made of that, I needed to respect her feelings and not go too
      overboard, which I do and don’t realize. She was hesitant but she did give
      it a go, that was very, very kind of her and despite practicing for hours
      and watching countless videos, I was pathetic and bad but still fondly
      remember swinging to “‘Cause all of me Loves all of you”. How couldn’t I?
      I was dancing with the prettiest girl. Having never been to prom, that
      summed it for me and that was prom for me. My date was the prom queen! I
      have now also improved a lot. Future girlfriends and partners, I am ready
      for you! It is arguably the best day in the two years I have spent in
      Tempe.

      Tanushi, you may never get to read this, but I can’t see you upset or sad.
      It ruins my mood as well and makes me sad. You deserve all the happiness
      in the world, always! I hope tu tension and stress thodi kam le ab se and
      khush rahe bas. Love, Janss.
    </p>

      Picture abhi baaki hai mere dost. I have always been a filmy person. I
      love to read novels and watch content. I cry watching movies and am a very
      emotional person. I act all chilled out and cool and make others laugh but
      I am not always that person. I put out an act sometimes even though I am
      dying on the inside because I don’t want to be a burden on someone with my
      emotions or maybe I just don’t want to be vulnerable. I don’t share most
      of my feelings and some people might think they know a lot about me, but
      nobody does know the real me. Not even my best friends, my roommates, my
      exes, my hookups, or my parents. But there are some people in my life, I
      may not share everything with them, but I can be the real me in front of
      them and Tan is one such person and there are just a handful of such
      people in my life and I am so grateful to have her in my life.
    </p>
    <p>
      I subtly like to flirt with her (I know that’s true for most girls but am
      trying to be sweet here😊) and write for her, which she should feel
      special about! Umm, with us meeting lesser and lesser times, I found the
      perfect pick up line. Ladki pe blog likh raha hu, pick up line to banti
      hai! So here goes - ‘Andheri ki local ho kya, dekhne ko milti ho, pakadne
      ko nahi’. She was also genuinely concerned for me when the dadi thing
      happened. Talking about the latter, things like these put faith back in
      something you once valued highly and my relationship with her is one such
      example. I was so engrossed 
      and stressed over my dadi, I couldn’t solve one of the questions in her OA 
      which I would have solved in 10 mins any other day and that saddened me even 
      further. I don’t like letting people down, and she is one of the few good 
      ones in my life. Whether it’s meeting Sodu girl (South Dubai girl) for the first
      time seeing Chinese girls win all the prizes, catching a game of football,
      or her coming to meet me when I had a flight to India, a couple of meetups
      this year, or some good conversations we had in the last year, I will miss
      her when I am gone from here for good. Hopefully I find a job soon guys!
      The market is so bloody tough for new grads right now ☹. Well, I guess am
      going to finish this week’s blog now. I could literally write a novel on
      her, but let’s keep it short for you guys!
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, going back to the first para, why is she on my mind all the time? The
      girl, with such bad knowledge of maps and directions, has fractured her
      back. How can I be okay when my friend is not? Can’t say much to her
      directly, hope she takes care of herself for once and takes a little less
      stress. God, how will she travel back to USA in such condition! Just
      praying all goes well.
    </p>
    <p>
      By fate, I met her. By choice, I will stay. I never expected us to become
      friends, but we did. Half of you won’t get this joke, but here with her, I
      feel like Arsenal. I started on top and finished second! Sad! But when you
      have friends who check on you and want nothing but the best for you, keep
      them close. It’s not always that someone truly cares. With the difficult
      times I find myself surrounded by, I really just want to be surrounded by
      good people, good for me and for my soul. Anyways, the possibility of
      having her in my life is better than the reality of anyone else. I will be
      ever present for her. I wish such a day never comes, but I will be the
      shoulder she needs to cry on, I will be one call or text away whenever she
      needs to talk about anything. I know I have her support and she has mine,
      trust and support! Hopefully, we meet again. Would like to share something
      that may make her blush, would probably send this line to her on WhatsApp.
      It’s a line by Shakespeare changed a bit – ‘Tan, if I were to see you and
      go to hell, I would. Because then, I would be able to brag to all the
      devils in hell that I saw heaven without even entering it!’.
    </p>
    <p>
      And to answer the first question, who is she? She is just the most
      amazing, smart, incredible, beautiful friend one could ask for. Two things
      that you should know, before I truly conclude, number one, she owes me
      chhole and number two, my ass is much better than hers! Jokes aside
      (honestly, I am not joking), I pray this girl wins in life, with or
      without me. I want to see her at the very top.
